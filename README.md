# DeepLearningXXL
Deep Learning Framework created by C plus plus
## Motivation
As we know, Python and other dynamic programming languages have dominated AI world and this is a public agreement. However, that could be the reason for us to give up traditional programming languages like Cpp and Java. Actually, in many aspects, we still need the help and power of Cpp such as OpenGL and OpenCV and so forth. That's why I start this project to create an easy and flexible framework of deep learning in Cpp. Everybody, this world deserves diversity especially in computer and science world.

## Primary usage
This framework will not be used in comercial. And its function cannot afford either. We construct it for a more comvenient and customed development with deep learning in other subjects. All right, let Python go its way. We just make a little difference for our own jobs. We hope this project could help some scientists and researchers to use Cpp to deploy their own deep learning networks to meet their current works or projects in Cpp.

## How to contribute
For this project, we need more and more enthusiastic people to help make the sub-modules like optimzers and layers and complete the core function of backward. If possible, we hope to develop its visualization better. I always think programming language should not be the block.

## Challenge Python
Absolutely not! We are not going to beat other framworks or programming languages, which is not our purpose at all. We just find extant frameworks are not easy to modify it layer structure and inner mathematic topology. We need a light and efficient framework to recreate anything we want and need to satisfy our research works. We need it so it is neceaasary!

## Welcome anyone to join
We need your help!
